## Ingredients

### Ribs

- 2 racks of baby back ribs (about 2-3 pounds each)

### Rub

- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup paprika
- 2 tablespoons black pepper
- 2 tablespoons kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)

### Other

- Wood chips or chunks (hickory, oak, or pecan)
- Spray bottle with apple cider vinegar or apple juice
- Barbecue sauce (optional, for glazing)


## Instructions

### 1. Preparation

**Prepare the ribs**

- Remove the membrane from the back of the ribs by inserting a knife under it and peeling it off.

**Season the ribs**

- Mix all rub ingredients in a bowl.
- Generously apply the rub to both sides of the ribs, pressing it in to adhere.


### 2. Smoking the Ribs

**Prepare the Smoker**

- Preheat your smoker to 225°F (107°C).
- Add wood chips or chunks to the smoker box or directly to the coals.

**Smoke the Ribs**

- Place the ribs bone-side down on the smoker grate.
- Close the lid and maintain a consistent temperature of 225°F (107°C).

**Spritzing**

- After the first 3 hours, start spritzing the brisket with apple cider vinegar or apple juice every hour to keep it moist.

**Wrap the ribs**

- After 3-4 hours, or when the ribs have a nice bark and an internal temperature of about 160°F (71°C), wrap them tightly in aluminum foil.
- Optionally, add a little apple juice inside the foil for additional moisture.

Return the wrapped ribs to the smoker and continue cooking for another 2 hours.

**Glazing (Optional)**
- If you like a glazed finish, unwrap the ribs after 2 hours and brush them with barbecue sauce.
- Return the ribs to the smoker and cook unwrapped for an additional 30-60 minutes to set the glaze.

### 3. Finishing and serving

**Check for Doneness**

- The ribs are done when they are tender and the internal temperature is around 190-200°F (88-93°C).
- You can also check by bending the ribs; they should crack slightly but not fall apart.

**Rest the Ribs**

- Let the ribs rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing.
- Slice the ribs between the bones and serve with your favorite sides.

## Estimated Time

- **Preparation**: 30 minutes
- **Smoking**: 5-6 hours
- **Resting**: 10-15 minutes
- **Total**: 5.5-6.5 hours
