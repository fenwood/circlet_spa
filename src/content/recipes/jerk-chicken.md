## Ingredients

- 1 whole chicken, about 4-5 pounds, preferably free-range or organic
- ½ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup white vinegar
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
- 2 tablespoons ground allspice
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon ground nutmeg
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 2-3 Scotch bonnet peppers, finely chopped (adjust to taste)
- Juice of 2 limes
- 2 green onions, chopped
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme      

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Marinade

- In a large bowl, combine soy sauce, olive oil, white vinegar, minced garlic, brown sugar, fresh thyme leaves, ground allspice, black pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, paprika, salt, chopped Scotch bonnet peppers, lime juice, chopped green onions, chopped onion, and dried thyme. Mix well to combine.

### 2. Prepare the Chicken

- Rinse the chicken thoroughly under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels.
- Using a sharp knife, make shallow cuts on the chicken to help the marinade penetrate.
- Place the chicken in a large resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish.

### 3. Marinate the Chicken

- Pour the jerk marinade over the chicken, making sure it is evenly coated.
- Seal the bag or cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to develop.

### 4. Prepare the Smoker

- Preheat your smoker to 250°F (120°C). Use your favorite wood chips or chunks for smoking. Traditional choices for jerk chicken include pimento wood, but you can use hickory, oak, or applewood for excellent flavor.

### 5. Smoke the Chicken

- Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard any excess marinade.
- Place the chicken on the smoker rack and smoke for 2.5 to 3 hours, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F (75°C), and the juices run clear.
- Rotate the chicken occasionally for even smoking and browning.

### 6. Rest and Serve

- Once the chicken is done, remove it from the smoker and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
- Serve your smoked jerk chicken with traditional sides like rice and peas, grilled pineapple, or Jamaican festival bread for an authentic island experience.
