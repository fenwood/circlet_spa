## Ingredients

### Rub

- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup paprika
- 2 tablespoons black pepper
- 2 tablespoons kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)

### Other

- Wood chips or chunks (hickory, oak, or pecan)
- Spray bottle with apple cider vinegar or apple juice
- Barbecue sauce (optional, for glazing)
- 8-10 hamburger buns
- Coleslaw (optional)


## Instructions

### 1. Preparation

**Prepare the pork shoulder**

- Trim excess fat from the pork shoulder, leaving a thin layer to keep the meat moist during smoking.

**Season the pork shoulder**

- Mix all rub ingredients in a bowl.
- Generously apply the rub to all sides of the pork shoulder, pressing it in to adhere. Let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes.


### 2. Smoking the pork shoulder

**Prepare the Smoker**

- Preheat your smoker to 225°F (107°C).
- Add wood chips or chunks to the smoker box or directly to the coals.

**Smoke the pork shoulder**

- Place the pork shoulder on the smoker grate.
- Close the lid and maintain a consistent temperature of 225°F (107°C).

**Spritzing**

- After the first 3 hours, start spritzing the pork shoulder with apple cider vinegar or apple juice every hour to keep it moist.

**Wrap the pork shoulder**

- After 6-8 hours, or when the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C), wrap the pork shoulder tightly in aluminum foil or butcher paper.
- Return the wrapped pork to the smoker.
- Continue smoking until the internal temperature of the pork shoulder reaches 195-205°F (90-96°C), which may take an additional 4-6 hours.

### 3. Finishing and serving

**Resting**

- Remove the pork shoulder from the smoker and let it rest, wrapped, in a cooler or warm place for at least 1 hour.

**Shred the pork**

- Unwrap the pork shoulder and use two forks or meat claws to shred the meat. Discard any large pieces of fat.

**Assemble the Sandwiches**

- Pile the pulled pork onto hamburger buns.
- Top with barbecue sauce and coleslaw, if desired.

## Estimated Time

- **Preparation**: 30 minutes
